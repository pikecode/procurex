# ProcureX Development Progress

Last updated: 2026-09-26

## Current Position

The backend has started M5 reporting development; M4 settlement adjustments remain incomplete.

Latest completed implementation: DEV-406 pending adjustment offsets reserve supplier payable balances in payment previews.

Latest committed implementation before the current work:

```

Confirmed payment allocations now create immutable settlement item amount snapshots in one transaction. Store, supplier total, and supplier-store statement lines and later payment previews read those snapshots, while items without a confirmed payment remain dynamic. Snapshot rows cascade with test data cleanup.

Direct supplier-term statements now use their B04 settlement item ID with the B06 payment preview/create/confirm flow and retain direct channel metadata.

Recommended next step: complete W11 role acceptance and begin M5 notifications/export operational review. M4 post-settlement adjustments and B12 overpayment remain unfinished and must not be marked complete.

DEV-406 continues after the scope hardening commit. Payment previews now subtract both PENDING and CONFIRMED difference offsets from payable availability, preventing a second payment reservation while an offset awaits confirmation. Payment and offset creation now use the same PostgreSQL transaction advisory locks for settlement item IDs; credit return IDs are locked before duplicate disposal checks. Payment list/detail, preview, registration, and confirmation now apply the authenticated store or supplier scope. B12 confirmation-role acceptance and broader concurrency evidence remain to be reviewed; M4 is still incomplete.

## Progress Metrics

The project uses two fixed metrics. **Core backend implementation: about 70%–75%** — the previously reported figure, covering the main API, data models, migrations, permissions, settlement reads/payments, fulfillment, pricing, reports, and exports already implemented. **Full release acceptance: about 40%–45%** — the stricter figure, also requiring all role pages, complete M4 adjustment handling, notifications, audit/reconciliation, task recovery, regression evidence, and M6 deployment/launch acceptance. The difference is scope, not a regression; future updates must label which metric they use.

## Verification Baseline

The latest completed stage passed:

```bash
npm run db:validate && npm run db:migrate && npm run build && npm test && npm run test:integration && npm run contract:check
```

Current integration coverage count: 26 integration tests passing; unit coverage is 12 tests.

DEV-406 scope hardening: adjustment list/detail and difference-disposal detail/confirmation now enforce the authenticated store or supplier scope before returning or mutating records. Company roles retain the existing company access paths.

Current verified change: price-change runs now report FAILED when any child order fails; P02 revaluation refreshes purchase-request funding summaries; purchase confirmation recalculates funding from current item amounts and current account balance before splitting. Payment preview blocks unresolved positive shortfalls and company-term supplier payments whose store receivables are not confirmed paid. Price changes do not mutate balances or ledgers.

DEV-501 R01-R03 backend slice is implemented. `completedAt` is persisted and written when fulfillment becomes complete; existing completed orders are backfilled by migration. R01 reports completed-order amounts by completion month, R02 final received quantities by completion date with a three-month limit, and R03 completed non-direct order profit by first shipment date with freight separate. Date filtering uses Asia/Shanghai day boundaries; completed order prices are frozen by P02's completed-order exclusion. Local migration, build, 10 unit tests, 26 integration tests, contract check, and diff check passed.

Report access now accepts store and supplier roles for R01/R02 and forces their bound `UserScope` into the query. R03 remains company-only. I05 `PATCH /users/{id}` can assign one COMPANY, STORE, or SUPPLIER scope; the scope is included in login authentication context. The scope migration is deployed locally.

W11 first usable web screen is implemented in `apps/web`: login, R01-R03 tabs, date/entity filters, KPI summaries, result tables, empty/error states, and CSV export. Start with `npm run start:web`; API CORS permits the local web origin.

R04 creates a persisted export job (202), claims queued CSV jobs atomically with PROCESSING status, exposes status and owner-only download routes, rechecks the current report role and bound account scope, and expires snapshots after seven days. The API polls queued jobs after restart and cleans expired content; storage is database text rather than private object storage.

Statement and adjustment period grouping now uses the supplier order's settlement cycle snapshot, so changing supplier defaults does not move historical orders.

- Validates each shipment item belongs to the shipment.
- Requires receipt items to cover all shipment items exactly once.
- Validates received quantity is between zero and shipped quantity.
- Updates `OrderItem.receivedQuantity`.

- Tracks PENDING, CONFIRMED, REJECTED, and USED statuses.
- Confirmed freight can be attached to a shipment once and is marked USED.
- Uses Idempotency-Key through command records.

## Known Boundaries

- Current access control is role-based. Supplier-user and store-user data-scope binding is not implemented yet.
- Funding logic is still a first pass. It records stored-value summaries and O11 reconciliation results but does not yet implement the complete immutable allocation/ledger behavior described in the long-term design.
- F03 stores permanently reduced quantity on shipment items. Replenishment gap allocation is supported when the caller provides explicit `gapAllocations`.
- F05 RETURN currently records internal shortage-return resolution. Downstream supplier statement/payment disposal remains future work.
- Settlement and reconciliation remain future work.
- Frontend pages are not implemented yet.

### Store Finance

- Writes a CREDIT account ledger with source type RECHARGE.
- Uses Idempotency-Key through command records.

Current A03 behavior:

Current B01 behavior:

- Dynamically groups completed supplier orders into store-side statements by store, supplier, settlement cycle, and first shipment period.
- Uses the store sales amount plus shipment freight as the store statement total.
- Returns open statement summaries with goods amount, freight amount, total amount, payable amount, and line count.
- Returns statement details with source supplier order lines and source revision.
- Keeps payment and settlement status as an OPEN read model in this first version; allocation and confirmed payment are future work.

- Dynamically groups completed supplier orders into supplier total statements by supplier, settlement cycle, and first shipment period.
- Uses the supplier supply amount plus shipment freight as the supplier payable total.
- Returns open supplier statement summaries with goods amount, freight amount, total amount, payable amount, store count, and line count.
- Returns supplier statement details with source supplier order lines, store IDs, and source revision.
- Keeps payment and settlement status as an OPEN read model in this first version; shared payment allocation is future work.

- Dynamically groups completed supplier orders into supplier-store statements by store, supplier, settlement cycle, and first shipment period.
- Uses the supplier supply amount plus shipment freight as the supplier-store payable total.
- Returns `parentStatementId` pointing to the matching supplier total statement for the same supplier and period.
- Returns supplier-store statement details with source supplier order lines and source revision.
- Keeps payment and settlement status as an OPEN read model in this first version; shared settlement item IDs are future work.

Current B05 behavior:

- Dynamically exposes F05 RETURN `DiscrepancyReturn` records as supplier payable decrease adjustments.
- Calculates adjustment amount from returned quantity times source supplier order item supply unit price.
- Returns original supplier statement ID and original period based on the source order first shipped time.
- Returns actual adjustment period based on the return record creation time.
- Supports filtering by storeId, supplierId, cycle, actual period, and processingStatus.
- Marks adjustments DISPOSED when linked to a confirmed `DifferenceDisposal`, otherwise PENDING_DISPOSAL.
- Store receivable adjustments, direct settlement adjustments, price-change adjustments, and persisted adjustment documents remain future work.

Current B06 behavior:

- Statement detail lines expose stable virtual `settlementItemId` values.
- Store statement lines preview as `STORE_TO_COMPANY` payment items using sales amount plus shipment freight.
- Supplier total and supplier-store statement lines share supplier payable IDs and preview as `COMPANY_TO_SUPPLIER` items using supply amount plus shipment freight.
- Validates selected items are completed, share the same payment direction, and belong to the same paying/receiving subject.
- Returns payable amount, pending amount, confirmed paid amount, source version, and blocked items.
- Includes existing RESERVED allocations as pending amounts.
- Blocks positive unresolved purchase funding shortfalls and, for COMPANY_TERM supplier payable items, requires the related store receivable to be fully confirmed paid.

Current B07 behavior:

- Adds `PaymentRecord` and `PaymentAllocation` models.
- Creates a PENDING payment record from previewed settlement item IDs.
- Validates selected items share direction and subject, source versions match, and expected amounts match current payable amounts.
- Creates RESERVED payment allocations so later previews show pending payment amounts and no remaining payable amount for the same items.
- Uses Idempotency-Key through command records.

Current B08 behavior:

- Confirms PENDING payment records with expectedVersion checking.
- Marks the payment record CONFIRMED and increments its version.
- Converts RESERVED allocations to CONFIRMED.
- Later payment previews show confirmed paid amounts and no remaining payable amount for confirmed items.
- Uses Idempotency-Key through command records.

Current B09 behavior:

- Rejects PENDING payment records with expectedVersion checking and a rejection reason.
- Marks the payment record REJECTED and increments its version.
- Converts RESERVED allocations to RELEASED.
- Later payment previews ignore RELEASED allocations, so rejected items become payable again.
- Uses Idempotency-Key through command records.

Current B10 behavior:

- Cancels PENDING payment records with expectedVersion checking and a cancellation reason.
- Marks the payment record CANCELLED and increments its version.
- Converts RESERVED allocations to RELEASED.
- Later payment previews ignore RELEASED allocations, so cancelled items become payable again.
- Uses Idempotency-Key through command records.

Current B11 behavior:

- Lists payment records ordered by creation time.
- Supports filtering by direction, status, storeId, and supplierId.
- Returns payment record details with allocation rows and allocation states.
- Keeps role-based access only in this version; participant data-scope filtering remains future work.

Current B12 behavior:

- Adds `DifferenceDisposal` and `DifferenceDisposalItem` models.
- Creates supplier-to-company offline-return difference disposals from F05 RETURN `DiscrepancyReturn` credit items.
- Creates supplier-to-company OFFSET difference disposals from F05 RETURN credit items to supplier payable settlement items.
- Calculates disposal amount from returned quantity times the source supplier order item supply unit price.
- Requires selected credit items to share the same store and supplier, and rejects already disposed credit items.
- Requires OFFSET target debit items to be completed supplier payable items for the same supplier with enough remaining payable amount.
- Confirms PENDING disposals with expectedVersion checking and records confirmedAt.
- Payment previews subtract confirmed OFFSET disposal amounts from target supplier payable items.
- Uses Idempotency-Key through command records for create and confirm.
- Overpayment, adjustment-driven credit items, direct settlement offsets, and evidence files remain future work.

Current B04 behavior:

- Implements `GET /direct-statements` and `GET /direct-statements/{id}`.
- Groups completed supplier orders for suppliers currently configured with `SUPPLIER_TERM` by store, supplier, cycle, and first shipment period.
- Uses sales goods amount plus shipment freight as the direct settlement total.
- Returns source order lines, stable direct settlement item IDs, source revision, and OPEN payment summary fields.
- Supplier order settlement mode and cycle are snapshotted at order creation; B04 filters and groups on these values, so later supplier configuration changes do not move historical orders.

Current settlement snapshot behavior:

- Adds `settlementMode` and `settlementCycleSnapshot` to supplier orders, with legacy rows defaulted to `COMPANY_TERM` and `MONTHLY`.
- Purchase confirmation and newly created reallocation orders snapshot the template override when present, otherwise the supplier defaults.
- Existing target orders retain their original snapshot when more items are reallocated into them.

Current price history behavior:

- Price versions persist the reason for each change and return it from publish and version history queries.
- Price versions persist a per-scope monotonic revision; the highest revision wins when effective times match, and publishing appends history in a transaction.
- P02 now creates a persisted pending price change run linked to the published version; each currently affected execution order is recorded as a pending run item, and `GET /jobs/{id}` exposes the status and deltas.
- `POST /jobs/{id}/process` applies pending order price changes in one transaction, records before/after prices and amount deltas, updates order/request totals, and marks the run successful.
- Revaluation refreshes the affected purchase request's funding summary against current store balance in the same transaction; positive shortfalls therefore block payment preview.
- The database integration test covers a real affected execution order, updated line totals, and persisted price adjustment source; repeated run processing returns 409.
- `GET /jobs/{id}` returns each processed order's adjustment ID and before/after sales and supply prices.
- `GET /jobs/{id}/adjustments` returns the persisted per-order adjustment source rows for later statement and payment reconciliation.
- Store, supplier total, supplier store, and direct statement detail lines include associated processed price adjustment IDs and deltas; statement amounts use current order totals once.
- P01 previews the uncompleted orders in the price version's effective interval and returns estimated sales and supply deltas; completed orders are excluded.
- Publishing remains synchronous; a separate worker queue and automatic asynchronous run pickup remain future work.

## Recommended Next Step

Complete DEV-501 role/data-scope behavior and API contract checks, then implement W11. Current report routes are company-role-only; store and supplier account data-scope binding is not implemented. Keep R03 restricted to PURCHASER/HQ_FINANCE/ADMIN.
